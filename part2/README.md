HBNB Project Part 2: Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints 🚀
Overview 📝
This part of the HBNB Project focuses on implementing the core functionality of the application based on previously designed architecture. The main goal is to build the Presentation and Business Logic layers using Python and Flask.
Objectives 🎯
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Set Up Project Structure 📂

Organize the project into a modular architecture
Create necessary packages for Presentation and Business Logic layers


Implement Business Logic Layer ⚙️

Develop core classes (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
Implement relationships between entities
Apply the facade pattern for layer communication


Build RESTful API Endpoints 🌐

Create CRUD operations for all entities
Use flask-restx for API definition and documentation
Implement data serialization for related objects


Test and Validate the API ✅

Ensure correct endpoint functionality
Handle edge cases appropriately
Test using tools like Postman or cURL



Tasks 📋
Task 0: Project Setup and Package Initialization ✨

Set up initial project structure
Organize code for Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence layers
Implement in-memory repository for object storage and validation
Prepare the project to use the Facade pattern

Task 1: Core Business Logic Classes 🏗️

Implement core entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
Define necessary attributes, methods, and relationships
Handle attribute validation and updates

Task 2: User Endpoints 👤

Implement API endpoints for user management
Set up POST, GET, and PUT operations
Integrate Presentation and Business Logic layers
Ensure password is not included in responses

Task 3: Amenity Endpoints 🛋️

Set up CRUD operations (except DELETE) for amenities
Implement necessary business logic
Integrate layers through the Facade pattern

Task 4: Place Endpoints 🏠

Implement place management endpoints
Handle relationships with other entities (User, Amenity)
Implement validation for specific attributes (price, latitude, longitude)
Return related data with Place information

Task 5: Review Endpoints ⭐

Set up CRUD operations (including DELETE) for reviews
Implement validation for review attributes
Associate reviews with users and places
Update Place model to include review collections

Task 6: Testing and Validation 🧪

Implement basic validation checks
Perform black-box testing using cURL
Generate and verify Swagger documentation
Create detailed testing reports

Important Notes 📌

Authentication (JWT) and role-based access control will be implemented in the next part
The persistence layer uses in-memory storage for now; database implementation comes in Part 3
DELETE operation is only implemented for Reviews in this part of the project
