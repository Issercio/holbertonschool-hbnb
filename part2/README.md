# 🏨 HBNB Project Part 2: Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints

## 📝 Overview

This part of the HBNB Project focuses on implementing the core functionality of the application based on previously designed architecture. The main goal is to build the Presentation and Business Logic layers using Python and Flask.

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

### 📂 Set Up Project Structure
- Organize the project into a modular architecture
- Create necessary packages for Presentation and Business Logic layers

### ⚙️ Implement Business Logic Layer
- Develop core classes (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- Implement relationships between entities
- Apply the facade pattern for layer communication

### 🌐 Build RESTful API Endpoints
- Create CRUD operations for all entities
- Use flask-restx for API definition and documentation
- Implement data serialization for related objects

### ✅ Test and Validate the API
- Ensure correct endpoint functionality
- Handle edge cases appropriately
- Test using tools like Postman or cURL

## 📋 Tasks

### ✨ Task 0: Project Setup and Package Initialization
- Set up initial project structure
- Organize code for Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence layers
- Implement in-memory repository for object storage and validation
- Prepare the project to use the Facade pattern

### 🏗️ Task 1: Core Business Logic Classes
- Implement core entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- Define necessary attributes, methods, and relationships
- Handle attribute validation and updates

### 👤 Task 2: User Endpoints
- Implement API endpoints for user management
- Set up POST, GET, and PUT operations
- Integrate Presentation and Business Logic layers
- Ensure password is not included in responses

### 🛋️ Task 3: Amenity Endpoints
- Set up CRUD operations (except DELETE) for amenities
- Implement necessary business logic
- Integrate layers through the Facade pattern

### 🏠 Task 4: Place Endpoints
- Implement place management endpoints
- Handle relationships with other entities (User, Amenity)
- Implement validation for specific attributes (price, latitude, longitude)
- Return related data with Place information

### ⭐ Task 5: Review Endpoints
- Set up CRUD operations (including DELETE) for reviews
- Implement validation for review attributes
- Associate reviews with users and places
- Update Place model to include review collections

### 🧪 Task 6: Testing and Validation
- Implement basic validation checks
- Perform black-box testing using cURL
- Generate and verify Swagger documentation
- Create detailed testing reports

## 📌 Important Notes

> **Note:** Authentication (JWT) and role-based access control will be implemented in the next part

> **Note:** The persistence layer uses in-memory storage for now; database implementation comes in Part 3

> **Note:** DELETE operation is only implemented for Reviews in this part of the project
